So, Shodan is a powerful tool for finding potentially vulnerable systems on the internet. It allows you to search for specific keywords or characteristics of systems, such as operating system versions or specific ports being used. By using Shodan, you can gain valuable information about the systems that may be vulnerable to attacks.

One important thing to note when using Shodan is that the data may be a few weeks old, as it cannot scan the entire world every day. Additionally, some systems may not have been found or may have closed certain ports since their last scan.

Despite these limitations, Shodan is an essential tool for both hackers and cybersecurity professionals to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities in systems. It helps paint a picture of the global landscape of connected devices and can aid in identifying areas that need attention or further investigation.
