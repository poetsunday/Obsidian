In summary, asset disposal and decommissioning are crucial processes that must be considered throughout an asset's lifecycle. Sanitization techniques like degaussing, Secure Erase, and Cryptographic Erase can help eliminate data remnants on storage devices before they are disposed of or recycled. Destruction methods such as shredding, pulverizing, melting, or incinerating storage media ensure the physical device itself is beyond recovery or reuse, especially for high-security environments.

Certification processes provide evidence that the sanitization, disposal, or destruction process has been securely executed and can be crucial for organizations required to comply with strict regulatory controls. Considering data retention requirements when developing asset disposal and destruction policies helps strike a balance between retaining valuable information and avoiding unnecessary storage costs and security risks.

Remember, the more data is stored, the more it needs to be secured. Following standardized procedures like those outlined by NIST can help ensure assets are properly handled throughout their lifecycle, increasing compliance, protecting organizational integrity, and maintaining reputational standing.
