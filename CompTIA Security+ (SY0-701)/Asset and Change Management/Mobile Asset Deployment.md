In today's business world, companies have several options when it comes to providing their employees with mobile devices for work purposes. The three main models are Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), Company-Owned Personal Enablement (COPE), and Choose Your Own Device (CYOD).

BYOD is a popular choice as it allows employees to use their personal smartphones or tablets, reducing the initial investment cost for the company. However, this model can pose security risks since employees' devices may not meet the organization's security standards.

COPE, on the other hand, involves the company providing employees with a personally enabled device that they can also use for personal purposes. This model provides greater control and standardization for the organization but requires higher upfront costs as the company needs to purchase devices for all employees.

The third model, CYOD, offers a middle ground between BYOD and COPE. Employees get to choose their device from a list of company-approved options. While this model still gives some degree of choice to employees, it allows organizations greater control over security and standardization.

Each model has its advantages and drawbacks. The best option depends on the organization's specific needs, budget constraints, and risk appetite. Cost, security, and employee satisfaction should be considered when making a decision.
