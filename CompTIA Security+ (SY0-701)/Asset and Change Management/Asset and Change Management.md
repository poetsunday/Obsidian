This section covers asset and change management in cybersecurity, emphasizing their importance in safeguarding an organization's data and infrastructure.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. Asset management involves identifying, cataloging, monitoring digital assets to reduce vulnerabilities and ensure consistent security protocols across all assets.
2. Change management ensures modifications to systems are made securely; this prevents unforeseen security gaps or misconfigurations.
3. Both practices provide a structured framework for preventing, detecting, responding to cyber threats.

# TAKEAWAYS:

1. [[Acquisition and Procurement]] involve sourcing, vetting, obtaining security technologies and services to bolster organizations' defenses against cyber threats.
2. Mobile asset deployments determine how personal and company-owned devices are managed within an organization's networks for cybersecurity.
3. Asset management in cybersecurity includes assignment and accounting, monitoring, tracking, ensuring a rigorous system of asset inventory checks and enumeration.
4. Asset disposal and decommissioning involve sanitization, destruction, certification, data retention policies to minimize risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
5. Change management in cybersecurity is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of systems; it involves strict approval processes, maintenance windows, thorough impact analysis.
