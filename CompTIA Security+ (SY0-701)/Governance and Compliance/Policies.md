Policies like acceptable use policies, information security policies, business continuity, disaster recovery, incident response, software development lifecycle, and change management serve as the backbone of IT [[governance]], guiding an organization's operations and ensuring compliance.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP): An AUP outlines the do's and don'ts for users when interacting with an organization's IT systems and resources.
2. Information Security Policies: These policies cover a range of areas including data classification, access control, encryption, and physical security to protect an organization's information assets from threats both internal and external.
3. Business Continuity: This policy focuses on how an organization will continue its operations even in the face of disruption or disaster.
4. Disaster Recovery: Closely related to business continuity, this policy specifically focuses on how an organization will recover its IT systems and data after a disaster.
5. Incident Response: An incident response policy is a plan for handling security incidents.
6. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): An SDLC policy guides how software is developed within an organization, covering all stages from initial requirements gathering to design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
7. Change Management: This policy governs how changes to the IT systems and processes are handled.
