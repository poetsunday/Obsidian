2. It involves strategic leadership, structures, and processes to ensure IT infrastructures align with business objectives.
3. Governance influences the creation of guidelines, [[policies]], [[standards]], and [[procedures]] directly.
4. Monitoring and revising governance become increasingly important as technology evolves, regulations change, and cultural shifts occur within the industry.

# TAKEAWAYS:

2. Regularly review and assess the effectiveness of your governance framework to identify gaps or weaknesses.
3. Update [[policies]], [[standards]], [[procedures]], IT infrastructure, or operations as needed to address changes in technology, regulations, or industry culture.
