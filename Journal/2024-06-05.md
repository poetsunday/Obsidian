- I was able to install Excel format into Obsidian, this took me a bit to figure out and I'll have to play around with this function a bit to learn what it does and can do. There is an import and export option to this. I have imported 2 inventories to the Day & Ross folder. Both UPS and Printers.
- This will be one of the last 3 days, I assume for the construction works to be at our house. The Garage is built, siding is on. The Porch is finished minus the screen door. The Team is putting in windows today. More on this later...
- Only one widow will be installed today it looks like, II have been insured that these will be finished on the inside as well. I still do not have electrical in my garage.



To Do:
- Inspection for Car
- Battery replacement at iNoc
- Chainsaw
