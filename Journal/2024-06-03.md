started the day with getting Obsidian installed on my work computer. It is an application install that installs to the current user  on the PC. 
My thoughts are to start to use mark down language in my note taking, I have not figured out how I will convert this stuff to be usable with AI or my locate Ollama models.

I just found documentation on using LLM locally with Fabric. I believe I will need to reconfigure it on my two home computers to use efficiently.

I have installed importer on my work computer's Obsidian. I will need permission to import anything from my work OneNote.
I may just copy and paste.
