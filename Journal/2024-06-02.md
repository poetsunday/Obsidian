This is my first thought, input into Obsidian. I like this idea of this concept of Markdown language, and how this can be manipulated into various formats. 
I have opened a canvas, so I'll try and drag a photo to it and see how this works for me.

I could not drag a photo to the canvas, so I have a feeling that this is for some other use.

So now the task will to be Import all of my notes from OneNote and Trillian into Obsidian, and customize this for me so that I can use this over several systems.
