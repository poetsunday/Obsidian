There are many excellent free and open-source speech-to-text (STT) software options available. Here
are some popular ones:

1. ** Mozilla DeepSpeech**: An open-source STT engine that uses deep learning algorithms to recognize
spoken words. It's relatively accurate, even for noisy or imperfect audio recordings.
2. **Kaldi**: A widely used open-source toolkit for speech recognition and synthesis. While not
specifically designed for real-time dictation, Kaldi can be used for offline transcription tasks with
a moderate level of accuracy.
3. **Julius**: Another popular open-source STT engine that uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to
recognize spoken words. Julius is known for its high accuracy and support for multiple languages.
4. **CMU Sphinx**: A well-established open-source STT system developed by Carnegie Mellon University.
Sphinx is a robust toolkit with a wide range of features, including support for various languages and
audio formats.
5. **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (Open Source Edition)**: While not entirely free, Google's Cloud
Speech-to-Text offers an open-source edition that allows you to use their algorithms and models in
your own projects. This is a great option if you're comfortable with TensorFlow or Python.

Free speech-to-text software:

1. **Baidu Pico**: A simple, cloud-based STT service from Baidu that supports multiple languages and
has relatively good accuracy.
2. **Microsoft Azure Speech Services (Preview)**: Microsoft's cloud-based STT offering is still in
preview mode but provides a reliable and accurate transcription experience.
3. **IBM Watson Text to Speech**: Another cloud-based option, IBM Watson's Text-to-Speech service
offers real-time dictation capabilities with varying levels of accuracy depending on the audio
quality.

Keep in mind that while these options are free or open-source, they might not offer the same level of
accuracy as commercial solutions like Otter, Temi, or GoTranscript. If you require high-accuracy
transcription for professional use, consider exploring paid options.

Before choosing an STT software, consider your specific needs:

* Audio quality: Do you need to transcribe audio from a noisy environment or with a lot of background
noise?
* Language support: Are you working with multiple languages or just one?
* Accuracy: How important is high accuracy for your use case?
* Real-time dictation: Do you need to transcribe speech in real-time, or can you handle offline
transcription?

I hope this helps you find the perfect open-source or free STT software for your needs!
