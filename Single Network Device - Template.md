### Example 1: General Network Device Security Audit Checklist

1. **Device Identification**
   - Document the device type, model, and serial number.
   - Record the device's IP address and MAC address.

2. **Physical Security**
   - Ensure the device is physically secured in a locked cabinet or room.
   - Verify that access to the device is restricted to authorized personnel only.

3. **Firmware and Software Updates**
   - Check that the device firmware is up to date.
   - Ensure all software patches and updates are applied.

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Document the initial configuration settings.
   - Ensure that default passwords are changed.
   - Verify that unnecessary services and ports are disabled.

5. **Access Control**
   - Implement strong password policies.
   - Enable two-factor authentication if supported.
   - Configure role-based access controls.

6. **Network Security**
   - Ensure the device is placed in the correct network segment (e.g., DMZ for public-facing services).
   - WPA2/WPA3 security
   - Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the device.
   - Enable logging and monitoring of access attempts.

7. **Encryption**
   - Verify that data in transit is encrypted using protocols like SSL/TLS.
   - Ensure that sensitive data stored on the device is encrypted.

8. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Document backup procedures for the device configuration.
   - Ensure that backups are stored securely and tested regularly.

9. **Compliance and Policies**
   - Ensure the device complies with organizational security policies.
   - Verify that the device meets regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

10. **Testing and Validation**
    - Perform vulnerability scanning on the device.
    - Conduct penetration testing to identify potential security weaknesses.
