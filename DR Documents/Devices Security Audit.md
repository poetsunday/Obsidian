### Example 1: General Network Device Security Audit Checklist

1. **Device Identification**
   - Document the device type, model, and serial number.
   - Record the device's IP address and MAC address.

2. **Physical Security**
   - Ensure the device is physically secured in a locked cabinet or room.
   - Verify that access to the device is restricted to authorized personnel only.

3. **Firmware and Software Updates**
   - Check that the device firmware is up to date.
   - Ensure all software patches and updates are applied.

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Document the initial configuration settings.
   - Ensure that default passwords are changed.
   - Verify that unnecessary services and ports are disabled.

5. **Access Control**
   - Implement strong password policies.
   - Enable two-factor authentication if supported.
   - Configure role-based access controls.

6. **Network Security**
   - Ensure the device is placed in the correct network segment (e.g., DMZ for public-facing services).
   - Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the device.
   - Enable logging and monitoring of access attempts.

7. **Encryption**
   - Verify that data in transit is encrypted using protocols like SSL/TLS.
   - Ensure that sensitive data stored on the device is encrypted.

8. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Document backup procedures for the device configuration.
   - Ensure that backups are stored securely and tested regularly.

9. **Compliance and Policies**
   - Ensure the device complies with organizational security policies.
   - Verify that the device meets regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

10. **Testing and Validation**
    - Perform vulnerability scanning on the device.
    - Conduct penetration testing to identify potential security weaknesses.

### Example 2: Router/Firewall Security Audit Checklist

1. **General Configuration**
   - Verify that the router/firewall is running the latest firmware.
   - Ensure that default login credentials are changed.

2. **Access Control**
   - Configure access control lists (ACLs) to restrict management access.
   - Enable SSH for secure remote management.

3. **Firewall Rules**
   - Review and document all firewall rules.
   - Ensure that rules are configured to deny all by default and allow only necessary traffic.
   - Implement network address translation (NAT) where applicable.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Enable logging of all access attempts and configuration changes.
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities.

5. **Security Features**
   - Enable stateful packet inspection.
   - Configure intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
   - Implement VPN for secure remote access.

6. **Physical Security**
   - Ensure the device is physically secured and access is restricted.

### Example 3: Wireless Access Point Security Audit Checklist

1. **General Configuration**
   - Ensure the access point is running the latest firmware.
   - Change default SSID and disable SSID broadcasting if not needed.

2. **Authentication and Encryption**
   - Enable WPA3 or WPA2 encryption.
   - Use strong passphrases for wireless networks.

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement MAC address filtering.
   - Configure VLANs to segment wireless traffic.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Enable logging of all access attempts.
   - Monitor for unauthorized access points.

5. **Physical Security**
   - Ensure the access point is physically secured and access is restricted.

These templates provide a comprehensive starting point for auditing new network devices, ensuring they are secure and compliant with organizational policies and regulatory requirements. You can customize these templates based on your specific needs and the devices you are auditing[1][2][3][4][5].
